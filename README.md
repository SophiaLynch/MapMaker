# MapMaker

Sophia-edit2 notes:
Changed Map text box to a Domain Up Down since I feel like maybe it could work better, but if you disagree then I understand and it's an easy change. So when you create a new map, it should add in a Map 2 option. Not entirely sure how to go about clearing the previous info though.

Added another possible way to save files. Unsure of which would work better since I can't test it without the array.

Save file now works properly (it saves information out to a text file). Create new now automatically scrolls to the new map in the domainupdown, and it doesn't just add a 1 to the end of the map name. Still isn't perfect though in the sense that it won't ask the player to save the previous map first. Clear clears player positions, background image, etc. It also resets map name to Map 1, but there's sometimes an error when scrolling up where it remembers previous map names.
