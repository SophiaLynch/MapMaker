# MapMaker

Sophia-edit2 notes:
Changed Map text box to a Domain Up Down since I feel like maybe it could work better, but if you disagree then I understand and it's an easy change. So when you create a new map, it should add in a Map 2 option. Not entirely sure how to go about clearing the previous info though.

Added another possible way to save files. Unsure of which would work better since I can't test it without the array.

Took info Prof. Kalb put in and began expanding it to cover all four players' icons, locations, etc.

Thought about Prof. Kalb's advice on some of the buttons. Fixed the save button; it now writes to a textfile all of the information. Clear and Create New work better now as well.

Clear works properly. Added in functionality for "upload background" button. It just shows the file location for whatever image you choose. Still need to figure out how to make a save file dialog work when creating a new map...the way I tried made it crash.
 
Sophia edit 5 notes:
Added in a save file dialog that comes up when the users tries to clear or create new. Prompts them to go back and save before making changes.

Player spawning points are added to the map field properly and move around properly without arbitrarily resetting. Background can now be uploaded and appears in the map field. Began working on the upload button.
